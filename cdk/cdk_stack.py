# Note: The App instantiation and app.synth() for programmatic synthesis
# have been removed as per the plan to revert to CLI-based synthesis.
# The CDK CLI will look for an App instance defined in the global scope
# or a cdk.json file specifying the app entry point.
# For this to work with the CLI, we need to add:
# app = App()
# MyAppRunnerStack(app, "MyAppRunnerStackName")
